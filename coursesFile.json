It starts with a review of the characteristics of Mass Manufacturing and Lean Manufacturing and introduces the concept of Agile Manufacturing. It is proposed that the businesses practicing ‘mass manufacturing’ tend to invest funds in equipment and facilities as opposed to technology, people and information systems. Businesses practicing ‘lean manufacturing’ become cost efficient producers of goods and services by reducing waste and investing in technology. However, businesses practicing ‘agile manufacturing’ invest in people and information systems, respond quickly to market changes and anticipate the future demands of customers. The course covers the differences among the various modes of manufacturing as well as the advantages and disadvantages that each offers and introduces students to topics, such as: concept-to-cash time, virtual organizations, rapid Response to unanticipated changes, customer-focus approach, supply chain management, and innovation and implementation of advanced technologies. Additionally, brief discussions of ‘event-oriented thinking’ versus ‘systems-thinking’ will be included. The lectures will be followed by several case studies. Students will be asked to research individual cases involving real companies, based on publicly available literature, evaluate them, based on agile manufacturing criteria that they have learned in class, and regularly present their findings and conclusions in form of reports and presentations to the class as a whole.",

Aside from promoting healthy lifestyles, public health is also responsible for detecting, preventing, and responding to diseases. It is essential for public health to address mental health since it affects both physical and social well-being. Living a fulfilling life depends on how people relate to others, make decisions, handle stress, and manage their mental health. Identifying risk factors, improving mental health awareness, eliminating stigma associated with treatment, eliminating health disparities, and improving access to mental health services for all people, especially those who are disproportionately affected are among the public health challenges. Providing culturally sensitive programs and services to all communities requires understanding different cultural perceptions about mental health and limited access to care. Bringing a sense of wellness to communities that would otherwise lack proper access to care is possible by understanding mental health as a public health issue.",
